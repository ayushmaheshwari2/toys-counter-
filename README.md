# An app made using HTML ,CSS and JS to do some of the basic countings and keep track of things .
# I learnt the following topics while completing the app:
1.  Script tag
2.  Variables
3.  Strings
4.  console.log()
5.  Functions 
6.  The DOM
7.  getElementById()
8.  innerText 
9.  textContent(which is better than innerText because it doesn't go per frame which takes lots of memory)
